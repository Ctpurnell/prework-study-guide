# pre-work-study-guide3

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I wish I would have written more notes down.

## Usage

To use this studyguide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command-Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). You can also right click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect". When the window opens, open the console. There you will see a list of toppics we learned from Prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
